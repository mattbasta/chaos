Chaos Chimp is designed around the principle of Netflix's Chaos Monkey testing
platform. The idea is that if a piece of code is permuted such that it *should*
break the tests and the tests don't fail, the code is either:

- Dead
- Uncovered

Chaos Chimp goes a long way to make this work. It sequentially breaks nodes in
a Python script's AST tree. If the tests pass after each modification, then a
failure is logged and the AST node is saved for later analysis.

I designed Chaos Chimp to aid in improving deep code coverage of Mozilla's
amo-validator:
